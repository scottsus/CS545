[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/csci545/ros_ws/src/aikido/src/perception/CMakeLists.txt:33 (message):
  The installed version of DART 6.7.3 is missing
  dart::dynamics::VoxelGridShape, which is because DART built without
  octomap.  Please rebuild DART from source with octomap installed to enable
  VoxelGridModule in AIKIDO.  If you installed DART from the PPA on Ubuntu
  Trusty (14.04 LTS), you need to build DART from source.  This is because
  octomap is absent on Trusty.
